   Solar powered water trash collectors are designed to remove trash and other debris from water bodies using renewable energy sources. These systems can help to improve the health of aquatic ecosystems and protect wildlife by reducing the amount of plastic and other pollutants in the water. 
   A solar powered water trash collector typically consists of a floating platform with a series of barriers or a strainer that captures floating debris as it passes through the water. The platform is powered by one or more solar panels which generate electricity to power the motors and motor driver . As the platform moves through the water, the trash is captured by the barriers and directed to a collection bin or conveyor for removal.
